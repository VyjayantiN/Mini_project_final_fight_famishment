<h1>Fight Famishment</h1>
<h3>Idea</h3>
We came up with this idea to identify malnutrition and assess general health of children under 5 in rural areas.<br>
<h3>About the website</h3><br>
This is a website which suggests nutritional food items and recipes for children depending on their BMI. This BMI is calculated through the biological details of the child entered by the user. The list of food items and recipes provided are based on the availability and affordability of the resources in the specified rural region.
<br><br>
Our website “Fight Famishment” attempts to meet the nutritional demands of the child using natural alternatives instead of the high-priced products which are not available in the rural areas. The solution targets children under 5 to maintain the BMI range and to improve the general health.
<h3>
<br>Tech stack</h3><br> Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript,Python
<h3>Future Scope</h3>
<br>
We want to extend the website throught the country after gathering adequete resources. The website could be made simpler by implementing in regional languages to ensure better understanding.Also planning to integrate with ML model to predict when the user would recover by eating the food items recommended to him.
